  we are single threaded beings
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-07-18</strong></p>
<p>this post is poorly written, but it captures something.</p>
<p>a realization that i've been having more and more is that humans are single threaded beings.</p>
<p>i won't go into the whole spiel about how modern society is <strong>too busy</strong> and how we are constantly bombarded by stimulus. you know this.</p>
<p>but i'm now convinced that this has a negative effect on me. i almost never do a single thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>when i brush my teeth, i'm also watching YouTube</li>
<li>when i cook, i'm also listening to a podcast</li>
<li>when i eat, i'm also watching tv</li>
<li>when i run, i'm also listening to music</li>
</ul>

<p>eating healthy is something that i find extremely difficult. more precisely, i have a hard time not over-eating. this is an area of my life where i want to force myself to be <em>single threaded</em> and focus on the food that i am eating, without the distraction of the tv. focusing on the actual eating will hopefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>make me stop eating when i'm actually full, instead of eating mindlessly</li>
<li>make me appreciate the food more, by focusing on my little taste buds</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social">social</h3>
<p>while discussing, humans love seeing their listeners paying attention to what they are seeing. this shows interest and strengthen the relationship. here are a couple of recurring situations where i want to practice participating <em>single threadly</em> discussions</p>
<ul>
<li>when talking with my partner, and this applied also for small discussions like when we chat after coming back from work. i want to be present and listen fully</li>
<li>when talking with my mom / friends on the phone. often, during phone calls, i'll do something else, run, cook, work, etc. this is borderline insulting for them, i shall try to pause whatever else i was doing and fully focus on the discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>people familiar with the practice of mindfulness will hopefully resonate with some of the content on this page. mindfulness is a subject that i find fascinating and i expect more content related to it in the future.</p>
