<p>great book, i really enjoyed it. i wish i could have taken a class with Donella.</p>
<p>the book is well written and concise, packed with information. it opened my mind to see the world in a different paradigm: systems thinking.</p>
<p>while reading, i couldn't stop thinking about software systems i interacted with at work. dealing with in-flows, out-flows, stocks, delays, traps; all felt very applicable and relatable.</p>
<p>i also liked her criticism of capitalism and our societal neglect of the environment.</p>
