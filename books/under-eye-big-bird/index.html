<p>wow, what an interesting book. i've always had a soft spot for dystopian science-fiction.</p>
<p>this book is written is a very interesting way, where each chapter is narrated by a different character. this makes the book difficult to understand, especially the first few chapters. what adds to the confusion is that there isn't a lot of context building, at least initially. however, i think that this slight confusion improves the experience of reading this book. we want to understand, so we continue reading.</p>
<p>the end of the book clarifies many of the questions that floated through my head.</p>
<p>because of the book structure, it makes me want to read it again. i think the second read would be a totally different experience.</p>
<p>artificial intelligence is also of such current affair that it made the book feel ever so real (and scary).</p>
<p>i also appreciate how the <em>mothers</em> described humanity, I enjoy when authors create non-humans characters as vehicles to <em>attempt</em> to define humanity.</p>
<p>here are some of my favorite quotes (in order of appearance):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I loved me. But I also didn’t love me. Both these things were true, as far as I could tell.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is funny because she has many clones, so <em>me</em> means a different physical body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How else could they have carried on spreading war and famine and pollution like they did for quite so long? Talk about hubris!”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thoughts? Not really. I just sit and feel the bench under my butt, and sense the temperature changing on my skin, and from time to time I notice how the light hits or the wind’s blowing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inside love, there was hate.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You’re a very human human. You create things, and you destroy more than you create.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And yet, irony of ironies: whenever a change budded in you, a corrective force also arose, without fail, to resist it. Thus you would be the cause of your own destruction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You humans. Who once were alive, just like me. May you find a way to save yourselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>
