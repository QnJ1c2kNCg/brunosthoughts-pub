<p>very interesting book. to me, this is the kind of book that is interesting at the second degree. meaning that it's not a page turner where there is a ton happening, but, after finishing it, you start to think about some of the concept at a deeper level.</p>
<p>i have to say, i got a bit scared of how dystopian the world was portrayed, yet close to our modern reality.</p>
<p>some other random thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li>being a parent seems extremely difficult</li>
<li>scape, galaxies and the universe are things i'd like to understand better</li>
<li>the world is truly going to shit</li>
<li>i want to spend more time in nature</li>
<li>being able to modify someones brain is interesting</li>
<li>who are we? can we forget who we are as an individual?</li>
</ul>
