  Designing Data-Intensive Applications â€”  Martin Kleppmann
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-03-01</strong></p>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>score: 9.4</strong></p>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>type: non-fiction (tech)</strong></p>
<p>this is the best technical book i've ever read, hands down. Kleppmann is a master at explaining difficult in a way that is easy to understand. <em>while</em> remaining extremely technical which each point backed by a plethora of white papers.</p>
<p>one of the reason i liked this book so much is that it felt relatable. the book focuses on how databases are made, and well, that's what i'm building at work. i remember, on evenings, i kept interrupting Sofia's reading by saying: <em>Wow, this is so good! this is exactly what we're doing at work!</em>. </p>
<p>this book will remain a reference for the years to come, and i'd love to write my own little database one day...</p>
