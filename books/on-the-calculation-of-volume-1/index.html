  On the Calculation of Volume I â€”  Solvej Balle
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-03-09</strong></p>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>score: 5.5</strong></p>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>type: fiction</strong></p>
<p>interesting execution on an already done concept. beautiful writing and translation, but overall it wasn't really my cup of tea. i prefer books with a tad more action.</p>
<p>living the exact same day, again and again sounds like torture.</p>
<p>around half way through the book, i started feeling very <em>scared</em>, there was an unsettling feeling.</p>
<p>overall, i'm glad I read it, but i will not read the sequel nor recommend this book.</p>
