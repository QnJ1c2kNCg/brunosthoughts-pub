<p class="subtitle"><strong>score: 7</strong></p>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>type: non-fiction</strong></p>
<p>very good read for folks in the industry; especially if you have an interest in the hardware (like i do).</p>
<p>i like the way the book is structured, covering the inception of the transistor all the way to modern-day technologies and conflicts.</p>
<p>i would like to read more on the actual technologies though, the book stayed fairly high level.</p>
<p>the book made me appreciate how complex geopolitical conflicts are and how countries can apply pressure points to advance their agendas.</p>
<p>it's also mind-blowing how advanced/complex this technology is and how only a few players are competing for market share.</p>
<p>i would recommend this book.</p>
